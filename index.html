        <H1>The Bird That Couldn't See</H1>
        <H2>Chapter 1: The nest was my entire world</H2>
        <P>
            I remember waking up to sounds of others, both of them were crying, but I felt calm and how could I not, her feathers were like a blanket, a warm and cozy blanket.
            They called her mom, so i started calling her mom too, she was nice, she would keep us warm and give us food.
            She would leave us for sometime and then come back with more food. 
            However, Ben was a picky eater, he would cry even if he was the one eating first,
            Nami on the other hand would cry the entire time mom was away.
            Ben and Nami would talk about other birds that were around us. I felt left out because they would often talk about others flying around, 
            and I didnt know what that was so I would keep it to myself and just listen to both of them talk. 
            One day Ben was telling Nami, that in order to fly we need to flap our wings and that someday he will leave 
            this nest and go fly somewhere far away. I couldnt understand why anyone would want to 
            leave, this place was amazing, mom was amazing, she gave us everything and I thought to myself that Ben was stupid
            and I would never leave this place. That was the day when I found out that there was something called seeing
            as that was the day when mom didnt come back.
