        <H2>Chapter 2: I couldnt hear her</H2>
        <P>
            Mom left looking for food a long time ago and Nami wouldnt stop crying which annoyed me. After sometime I yelled at her
            and asked her to stop crying because her crying made it impossible for me to hear if mom was coming back. Ben suddenly started yelling 
            mom is back! mom is back! and I wondered how he knew because I didnt hear mom anywhere, so I asked him how could he hear
            mom, to which he replied "Why do I need to hear for mom when I can see that she is coming". So I asked him what seeing was
            and that is when I figured out that I couldnt see, and all that talk about other birds and flying made sense now. I was so focused on what Ben was saying that 
            we forgot that he saw mom coming back, so I asked him where she was and he said he thinks it was someone else, because they turned around. I started asking Ben about more this seeing thing,
            and thats when I heard someone else coming to our nest. Ben said it was Uncle Jack from the other tree, and he has seen him leave with mom for food. Uncle Jack came over to us and said that our mom and him
            were attacked by vultures and that she died in that attack. Jack said it would be better if we left the nest and went somewhere else, as the vultures could follow the smell back to us. There was so much going on
            so many things I didnt understand, but the only thing that I did understand was that I wouldnt be able to hear her anymore.
