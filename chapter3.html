        <H2>Chapter 3: It was time to leave</H2>
        <P>
            Jack told us that we should leave but none of us knew how to fly. Ben was more calm than I thought, Nami however started crying even harder. We
            needed to leave this nest and the first one to take that leap of faith was Ben, all I could hear was the sound of him jumping and then sound of something falling. My heart stopped as I couldnt hear Ben for some seconds
            and just when I was about to fall in despair, I could hear flappin of wings and then Ben yelling "I told you guys I could do it, Now come one you guys can do it too". Ben taking that leap of faith gave us courage and Nami followed him right after. I was pumped too so I took that leap of faith as well
            and little did I know I could flap my wings as well and the sensation of falling down was no more. Ben yelled "Come this way" so I started follwing his voice and then Wham!! I had hit something and then blacked out.
